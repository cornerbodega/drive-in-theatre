[done] Inventory Items need to be in firebase OR on a mongo... or something and/or I need pagination. Because otherwise the potting bench will not work. And I can't ship in good conscience.

Remember the wish.



3. Amazon log in. Amazon pay.


1. Usage Model
    Producer processors, retailers, labs get the link
    The link leads to '/'

    '/' landing
        Amazon Sign-In Widget
            onSuccess(setSessionAndlinkWithFirebaseAcount(ubi))
        Sign Up for Greenboard Button
            Leads to '/sign-up'

    '/sign-up'
        Amazon Sign-In Widget
            onSuccess(showNewUserInfoForm())
        New User Info Form
            form.username
            form.password
            form.license_number
            Create Account Button
                ng-click="createAccount(form)"
            createAccount = function(form) {
                lcbpost(form, function(){
                    if !success tell user to try FORM again. Do not pass go.
                    if success go to ('/home')
                })
            }
        Home is profile page
            Only you can see your list of inventory
            Each inventory Item will have a Strain, Inventory Type, Quantity, BarcodeID, date created, and QA information.
            For each inventory item, the user will be able to:
                A. Add a picture
                B. Add a description of the item
                C. Add an asking price for the item
                D. If the item has not been QA tested, schedule a pickup from a partnering QA lab.
                    D.1 Email labs to find partners! Ask them to pay 15% of business you give them.
                E. If the item has passed QA testing, publish the item to the public marketplace
                F. For free accounts, first post is free, future posts to the public marketplace are $20. Paid Accounts are $50/month and can create unlimited posts.
                    F.1 Phone call. I will make these deals happen. I will get these deals to happen. If necessary, at the beginning, we can do it manually but make it look like it's all tech.  And it is all tech...




























Client-ready MVP requires a standardized UI and a very specific goal.

Start out with Trim pitch because I understand it and it's more novel and lower risk for clients.

Establish Producer/Processor relationships. My pitch is to get them to go to the website.

From there, they'll sign up for an account and link their traceability info.

Then they'll be exposed to the marketplace / newsfeed. Trim market. Called Greenboard.
